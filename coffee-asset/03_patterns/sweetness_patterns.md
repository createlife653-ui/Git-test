# Sweetness Patterns / 甘味のパターン

## Common Correlation
- **Natural Process** -> Jammy, fermented sweetness.
- **Washed Process** -> Clean, refined cane sugar sweetness.
- **Honey Process** -> Muted acidity, enhanced body, rounded sweetness.

## Elevation Impact
- Higher elevation = slower maturation = higher sugar density.

## Extraction Correlation
- Sweetness is often the "peak" of extraction. It sits between sourness (under) and bitterness (over).
